# Chess assistant Tool
This tool uses image processing and machine learning to detect chess pieces on a screen, interact, play moves on the chessboard. 

I write this tool to dive in to the realm of python and machine learning, and learn to play chess.
## Features
- Chess board detection
- Piece detection
- Piece positions analysis and move recommendation
- Auto play

## Todo
- Enhance auto play feature
- BUG: sometimes, it confuses between black move and white move
- Software developement: write documentation and test.
